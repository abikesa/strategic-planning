## Subject: Ongoing Safeguarding and Fraud Investigation Update â€“ DRC Program

Dear Valued Partners and Stakeholders,

At GiveDirectly, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of transparency, integrity, and safeguarding. Today, I am writing to share an important update regarding a serious safeguarding concern reported in our DRC program.

### Background

In [Month, Year], we received a whistleblower report indicating potential safeguarding violations by former team members previously dismissed following the 2023 fraud investigation. The allegations detail instances where GiveDirectly staff reportedly solicited sexual favors in exchange for program enrollment. This conduct, if confirmed, is a grave violation of our policies and values.

### Immediate Actions

Upon receiving this report, we took the following urgent steps:

- Convened a crisis response task force including senior safeguarding, legal, regional leadership, and external experts.
- Launched a remote investigation, given the current conflict restrictions in the region.
- Engaged independent safeguarding consultants with regional expertise.
- Enhanced anonymous reporting channels through secure platforms and community networks.
- Suspended new enrollments in the affected areas as a precautionary measure.

### Protecting Program Participants

Our first priority is the protection of our recipients and communities. To that end, we are:

- Partnering with local NGOs and civil society groups to provide survivor-centered support.
- Reinforcing community education on safe and confidential reporting avenues.

### Investigation Process and Monitoring

We are currently gathering evidence through both remote and third-party investigations, with:

- Regular reporting from local partners.
- Real-time monitoring systems to identify any ongoing safeguarding threats.
- Preliminary findings to be shared with stakeholders within [X weeks].

### Long-Term Governance Enhancements

As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, we will:

- Update safeguarding protocols and deliver enhanced field staff training.
- Establish a third-party whistleblower platform with external oversight.
- Integrate AI-powered detection tools into program delivery platforms.

### Invitation to Engage

We value your partnership and welcome any information or concerns you may wish to share. Please reach us at [Secure Email Address/Hotline Number].

### Conclusion

We regret that such issues arose and remain deeply committed to safeguarding the dignity, trust, and safety of all program participants. We will continue to communicate transparently as our investigation progresses.

Thank you for your continued trust and partnership.

Sincerely,  
**Dr. Sarah Kayongo**
