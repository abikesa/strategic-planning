## a) Country Footprint Recommendations (2025–2028)

**Given GiveDirectly’s strategy of scaling impactful, efficient, and respectful interventions, combined with the goal of moving $500M annually by 2028, I recommend the following:**

### Consolidate and Deepen National-Scale Programs:
- **Rwanda and Malawi:** Continue scaling national-level programs. Build long-term government partnerships and integrated delivery systems. Leverage political goodwill and existing evidence base to position GD as a technical advisor to governments. Align with national development strategies to accelerate SDG Goal [^1].

- **High-Potential Countries (Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria):**
  - *Uganda*: Address rising refugee crisis (1,000,000+ refugees)[^2].
  - *Kenya*: Use robust fintech ecosystem, donor presence, and innovation to pilot hybrid models and app-enabled tools.
  - *Nigeria*: Scale replicable tools for larger country context, targeting over 70 million people under the poverty line[^3].

### Expand Crisis Response Capabilities:
- **Sahel Region (Niger, Chad)** and **Southern Africa (Mozambique, Madagascar)**: Increase climate and conflict readiness.
- **Francophone West Africa (Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal):** Rising donor interest and fintech growth justify pilots.
- **Ethiopia:** Leverage Airtel's 2023 market entry[^4] to design IDP-targeted programs.

### Rationalize Based on Evidence:
- Reduce presence in low-efficiency (<80%) countries.
- Pilot in Ethiopia and Sierra Leone due to poverty index rankings and recent fintech breakthroughs like M-Pesa and Airtel[^5].
- Test Islamic finance-compatible models in Francophone West Africa[^6].

  - Establish hubs in East, West, and Southern Africa
  - Pre-negotiated payment networks and procurement frameworks
  - Surge staffing

- **$1M – Technology & AI-Enabled Risk Mitigation:**
  - Invest in blockchain[^7] and satellite-based early warning systems
  - Strengthen fraud detection and crisis triggers
