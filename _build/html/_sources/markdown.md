# Strategic Planning

**TO:** Nick Allardice CEO, GiveDirectly  
**FROM:** Sarah Kayongo, VP, Programs  
**DATE:** March 21, 2025  
**SUBJECT:** Strategic Planning Recommendations: Country Footprint, Crisis Response, and Allocation of $100M in Flexible Funding  

---

### 1. Country Footprint Adjustments (Next 2–3 Years)

**Recommendation:** Prioritize strategic deepening over geographic expansion.

**Proposed Actions:**
- **Exit or pause operations** in geographies with sustained delivery or fraud challenges (e.g., **DRC**, currently paused and high-risk).
- **Double down** in high-impact, scalable markets: **Rwanda**, **Kenya**, and **Togo**. These countries offer strong government partnerships, operational track records, and data for long-term investment.
- **Pilot programs** in 1–2 strategically chosen, underrepresented regions (e.g., **Sahel** or **Horn of Africa**) where climate-driven poverty is acute and digital infrastructure (e.g., mobile money) is emerging.

**Rationale:**  
Chasing new country launches dilutes focus and risks executional mediocrity. Instead, we should become *the* global benchmark for cash delivery excellence in a concentrated footprint, then scale outward with political capital, data, and brand trust.

### 2. $5M Investment in Crisis Response Footprint

**Recommendation:** Build modular, tech-enabled crisis response infrastructure.

**Allocation Plan:**
- **$1.5M** – Develop a central Crisis Response Playbook + surge staffing system (including rosters, contracts, and SOPs).
- **$1.5M** – Stand up *pre-cleared, ready-to-launch* emergency programs in 3–4 diverse geographies (e.g., Nigeria, Turkey, Mozambique, Yemen).
- **$1M** – Pre-position tech systems (beneficiary ID pipelines, payment rails, satellite/AI targeting tools).
- **$1M** – Localized risk and safeguarding capacity-building in fragile contexts.

**Why:**  
Speed is everything in a crisis—but speed without integrity can kill trust. We must design crisis readiness like a startup: lean, modular, and nimble. This $5M should act as a *force multiplier*, not a shallow band-aid.

### 3. Allocation of $100M in Unrestricted Funds (Africa)

**Guiding Principle:** Cash is not enough—cash plus dignity, data, and durable exits.

**Allocation Framework:**
- **$60M** – Expand *sustained* basic income pilots in **Kenya** and **Rwanda**, generating gold-standard evidence and long-term impact.
- **$20M** – Launch adaptive, time-bound livelihood boosts in **Nigeria**, **Malawi**, and **Uganda** with localized exit strategies.
- **$10M** – Contingency and innovation: test digital ID-linked transfers in refugee populations or climate-vulnerable regions (e.g., Lake Chad Basin).
- **$10M** – Operational backbone: invest in talent, fraud detection, and safeguarding systems to de-risk future scale.

**Impact View:**  
This is not just about poverty alleviation—it’s about institutional credibility and global agenda-setting. Let’s not just be effective; let’s be *undeniable*.

---

**In summary:** GiveDirectly should become not just the best executor of cash transfers, but the global authority on how to do it *with trust, speed, and dignity*. The opportunity is here—and the world is watching.

Respectfully,  
Sarah Kayongo 
VP of Programs
