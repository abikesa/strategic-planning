MEMORANDUM

From: Sarah Kayongo, VP of Programs  
Date: March 21, 2025  
Subject: Strategic Planning Recommendations on Country Footprint, Crisis Response Investment, and $100M Allocation

### a) Given the strategy and goals outlined, what changes to our country footprint (if any) would you consider over the next 2-3 years? Why

GiveDirectly’s strategy of scaling impactful, efficient, and respectful interventions, combined with the goal of moving $500M annually by 2028, I recommend the following:

#### Country Footprint Recommendations (2025-2028)

**Consolidate and Deepen National-Scale Programs:**
- Continue scaling in Rwanda and Malawi where national-level programs are underway. Invest in building long-term government partnerships and integrated delivery systems. Leverage the political good will using evidence base (case studies, concept notes) to position GD as technical advisor to government, with a goal to undertake national poverty eradication programs in line with National Development strategy to accelerate the attainment of SDG goal number one[^1].
- Focus on countries with political stability, mature mobile money ecosystems, and high poverty concentrations (e.g., Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria). Uganda has one of the highest refugee populations in Africa (1,000,000), and the numbers keep rising given the ongoing unrest in DRC. Kenya’s strong economy, strong financial ecosystem combined with advanced digital innovation/fintech, strong presence of institutional donors, NGOs and Fortune 500) can serve as a strategic hub for piloting funding mechanisms evidence-based data to pilot hybrid cash transfer models and app enabled tools that could be replicated to larger countries like Nigeria at scale.

**Expand Crisis Response Capabilities in High-Risk, Underserved Regions:**
- Given climate risk and conflict volatility, increase readiness in the Sahel region (Niger, Chad) and Southern Africa (Mozambique, Madagascar).
- Evaluate piloting in Francophone West Africa (Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal) where donor interest and digital finance growth are rising.
- While most of Ethiopia is not directly impacted by civil conflict in Tigray, the recent launch of Airtel offers an opportunity to design impactful cash transfer projects for vulnerable populations and IDPs in the country.

**Why: Evidence Based Decisions to Rationalize Low-Efficiency & Scale**
- Reduce presence in countries where transfer efficiency falls below 80% and where institutional or infrastructural barriers prevent scale.
- Apply evidence-based data to pilot programs in new countries such as Ethiopia and/or Sierra Leone that still rank high on the poverty index yet continued to overcome barriers to communication by embracing digital money platforms (e.g. Safaricom launched M-Pesa mobile money service in Ethiopia; Airtel in August 2023)[^2].
- GiveDirectly’s model and value system lends itself to the Islamic financing model, hence justifying pilots and testing models in Francophone West Africa (Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal).

### b) Assume we have $5M to invest in establishing our crisis response capabilities and the footprint of countries we can do crisis response in. How should we invest that?

With the objective of delivering cash within five days post-crisis in 20+ countries, I recommend the following Crisis Response Investment Plan:

- **$2M – Regional Hubs & Prepositioned Readiness:** Establish three regional hubs (East Africa, West Africa, Southern Africa) with pre-negotiated payment agreements, emergency procurement frameworks, and dedicated surge staff.
- **$1M – Technology and AI-Enabled Crisis Detection, Fraud and Risk Mitigation:** Invest in AI-driven tools (blockchain) to enhance fraud surveillance platforms and integrate satellite-triggered cash delivery data in real-time.
- **$1M – Cross-Sectoral Partnerships & Agreements:** Formalize MoUs with governments, UN agencies, fintechs, banks, and mobile operators to ensure seamless permissions and data access during crises.
- **$1M – Capacity Building and Agile Management Structure:** Develop a crisis response task force trained in rapid assessments, disbursement protocols, risk detection, and field deployment. Create a regional management model that allows short-term deployment of staff to countries in crisis.

### c) We have $100M in flexible, unrestricted donations to allocate to any type of cash transfer programs anywhere in Africa over the next 12 months. What would be your key considerations and how would you propose allocating these funds?

#### Allocation Strategy for $100M Flexible Funds

The objective is to maximize recipient impact and drive GiveDirectly’s long-term strategic goals. GiveDirectly has already revolutionized direct cash transfers, but there is an opportunity to leverage technology, evidence-based data, partnerships, and financial ecosystems to drive long-term financial inclusion and economic mobility. Based on my experience and research, I propose a financially innovative and dynamic approach, assuming GiveDirectly will adapt while negotiating any changes in social, economic, and political environments.

#### a. Country Allocations ($70M):

- **Rwanda & Malawi National Scale-Up – $20M:** Leverage existing operations and involve in-country stakeholders such as Centenary Bank, Malawi (a leader in financial inclusion), and telecoms offering agent banking to improve real-time transfers and boost efficiency to 85%.
- **DRC & Mozambique – $15M:** Invest in conflict-prone and climate-affected areas with targeted "cash plus" interventions and fraud detection protocols including blockchain tech.
- **Nigeria, Kenya & Uganda – $25M:** Scale crisis response tools and urban poverty reduction in Kenya, youth and refugee support in Uganda (Africa’s largest refugee host), and reach IDPs and the 70M+ poor in Nigeria.
- **Pilot in Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal – $10M:** Market-entry and pilot studies in Muslim-majority regions (including Sierra Leone) to test culturally contextual models. Cote d’Ivoire could be a regional hub due to its mature financial ecosystem.

#### b. Program Type Allocations ($30M):

- **Crisis Response Reserve – $10M:** Use catalytic capital to generate compound interest. Launch cash-hybrid models with digital finance and community investment, inspired by work at Palladium on the USAID Kenya Investment Mechanism[^3].
- **Strengthen Local Market Ecosystems – $2M:** Support entrepreneurship and supply chains, use AI to identify market gaps, and ensure cash stimulates local production and job creation.
- **Innovative Finance (Cash+ Pilots) – $13M:**
  - Expand digital access: mobile savings, credit tools, and micro-investment (e.g., Ugandan treasury bonds for 25,000 shillings).
  - Launch micro-insurance, pooled savings, matched asset-building incentives (education, housing, health).
  - Integrate financial literacy via AI/chatbots/SMS or peer educators.
  - Blockchain smart contracts for fraud-proof cash flows.
  - Graduated cash incentives for milestones (schooling, entrepreneurship).
  - Income-generating transfers with mentorship and peer groups.
  - Community-pooled transfers (e.g., VSLA, as modeled successfully by CARE and detailed in my peer-reviewed article)[^4].

- **Technology and AI Integration – $3M:** Lessons from DRC fraud inform investments in blockchain, staff training, whistleblower apps, armored logistics, and cloud-based communication. Builds on prior work at Grameen Foundation and my dissertation[^5].
- **Evidence Generation and Thought Leadership – $2M:** Conduct rigorous studies (RCTs, experimental design), publish findings, and position GD as a trusted advisor to governments, donors, and the global development community.

---

### Key Considerations:

- Align with donor interests (climate, gender, resilience)
- Scale through innovative financing (hybrid models)
- Build local ecosystems and recipient agency
- Integrate technology and AI for efficiency and risk management
- Generate evidence and establish thought leadership
