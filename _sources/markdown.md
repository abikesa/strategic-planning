**MEMORANDUM**  

**To:** Nick Allardice, CEO  
**From:** Sarah Kayongo, VP of Programs  
**Date:** March 21, 2025  
**Subject:** Strategic Planning Recommendations on Country Footprint, Crisis Response Investment, and $100M Allocation  

---  

**1. Country Footprint Recommendations (2025-2028)**  

**Consolidate and Deepen National-Scale Programs:**  
- Continue scaling in Rwanda and Malawi, strengthening national-level programs through long-term government partnerships and integrated delivery systems. Position GiveDirectly (GD) as a technical advisor for national poverty eradication programs, aligned with national development strategies and SDG Goal 1: No Poverty ([link](https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/1-no-poverty/)).
- Focus on politically stable countries with mature mobile money ecosystems and high poverty concentrations (e.g., Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria). Leverage Kenya’s financial ecosystem as a strategic hub for piloting hybrid cash transfer models with potential expansion to Nigeria.
- Uganda, with its large refugee population (1M+), presents an opportunity for targeted intervention.   

**Expand Crisis Response Capabilities in High-Risk, Underserved Regions:**  
- Increase readiness in the Sahel region (Niger, Chad) and Southern Africa (Mozambique, Madagascar).
- Evaluate pilot programs in Francophone West Africa (Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal) to align with donor interest and digital finance growth.
- In Ethiopia, capitalize on the recent launch of Airtel to implement impactful cash transfer projects for vulnerable populations and IDPs.  

**Rationale:**
- Reduce operations where transfer efficiency falls below 80% due to institutional or infrastructural barriers.
- Pilot programs in high-need countries that have adopted digital financial platforms (e.g., Ethiopia and Sierra Leone).  
- Leverage Islamic financing models to justify expansion into Francophone West Africa.

**2. Crisis Response Investment Plan ($5M Allocation)**  

**Objective:** Deliver cash within five days post-crisis across 20+ countries.  

- **$2M – Regional Hubs & Prepositioned Readiness:** Establish three regional hubs (East, West, and Southern Africa) with pre-negotiated payment agreements and emergency procurement frameworks.  
- **$1M – Technology & AI for Crisis Detection & Fraud Mitigation:** Invest in AI-driven fraud detection, blockchain-based cash tracking, and satellite data integration for early response mechanisms.
- **$1M – Cross-Sectoral Partnerships & Agreements:** Formalize MoUs with governments, UN agencies, fintech firms, banks, and mobile operators to ensure seamless crisis response operations.
- **$1M – Capacity Building & Agile Management:** Develop a crisis response task force trained in rapid assessments, disbursement protocols, and field deployment, linked to regional hubs for agile response.

**3. Allocation Strategy for $100M Flexible Funds**  

**Objective:** Maximize impact for recipients while advancing GiveDirectly’s strategic goals.  

**Country Allocations ($70M):**  
- **Rwanda & Malawi – $20M:** Strengthen financial inclusion by partnering with local banks (e.g., Centenary Bank, Malawi) to integrate agent banking for efficient transfers.
- **DRC & Mozambique – $15M:** Support conflict-prone and climate-affected regions with cash-plus interventions and AI-driven risk mitigation.  
- **Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda – $25M:** Expand crisis preparedness and urban poverty reduction initiatives. In Uganda, address the refugee crisis (1M+ displaced persons).  
- **Côte d'Ivoire & Senegal – $10M:** Conduct market assessments, pilot cash transfers, and test the model in predominantly Muslim contexts. Côte d’Ivoire could serve as a Francophone hub.  

**Program Type Allocations ($30M):**  
- **$10M – Crisis Response Reserve & Catalytic Investment:** Use capital investment strategies to generate compound interest for long-term financial sustainability. 
- **$2M – Strengthen Local Market Ecosystems:** Connect recipients to business mentorship and supply chain networks to drive local economic growth.  
- **$13M – Hybrid Cash Pilots:** Expand digital financial tools, micro-investments, and savings platforms for recipient economic mobility.  
- **$3M – Technology & AI:** Implement blockchain-based fraud detection, digital ledger systems, and AI-driven financial literacy programs.  
- **$2M – Evidence Generation & Thought Leadership:** Conduct rigorous impact evaluations (RCTs, experimental design) and publish strategic findings to position GD as a trusted advisor to governments, donors, and private-sector partners.  

**Key Considerations for Allocation:**  
- Align with donor priorities (climate resilience, gender equity, economic mobility).  
- Leverage innovative finance mechanisms for scalability and capital optimization.  
- Strengthen local financial ecosystems to enhance recipient agency and long-term impact.  
- Utilize AI and blockchain to improve efficiency, risk management, and transparency.  
- Drive evidence-based policy influence through rigorous data and thought leadership.

**Conclusion**  

This strategic plan positions GiveDirectly to achieve its $500M annual cash transfer goal by 2028 while strengthening crisis response, financial ecosystems, and evidence-based policy influence. These recommendations optimize scalability, efficiency, and impact to drive sustainable poverty alleviation efforts in Africa.
